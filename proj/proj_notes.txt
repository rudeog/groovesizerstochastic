  AS - taking this groovesizer golf as a starting point to make the stochastic sequencer 
  when I started, global vars took up 1559

  global TODO
  - check for initial assignment in functions of locals, some may not be needed

 U I
 We can be playing/stopping in any mode
 A pattern will be considered ended when track 1 has run it's course

 Parameters:
 Global: (all settings managed thru pots)
   Tempo (50-255)
   Swing (0-99)   
   Random Regen (gen new random number every n steps) (1-32)
   delay pattern switch (y/n)
   send midi clock (y/n)
   send midi thru (y/n)
 Pattern (per pattern): (managed thru R-shift action)
   probabilities for next pattern to play (4 values) (0..15 where 0 is don't switch)
   num cycles to repeat (1..16)
 Track (per track, not pattern specific) (all except mute via pots)
   channel
   note num
   muted
   clock numer 1..4
   clock denom 1..4
   number of steps (1..32)
 Step (each step in each track in each pattern) (L-shift and click step)
   velocity
   probability

 Other needs:
   switch tracks for editing track and steps on track (F buttons 1..6)
   switch pattern (R Shift and F 1..4)
   hold current pattern R shift and F6
   on/off notes on track (on sets velo to highest, prob is unaffected)

Here's how it goes down:

There are 5 modes:
- NONE mode - default mode
- POTEDIT mode - pot 1 or 5 is at a non-zero location
- STEPEDIT modewhen l-shift and a step is selected
- LEFT mode - when L shift is held. return to NO mode when it's released unless entering STEP EDIT MODE
- RIGHT mode - when R shift is held. ends when it's released

 Pot 1: Select editable track level parameter
 Pot 2: edit that parameter
 Pot 3: tempo (with shift held just displays tempo)
 Pot 4: reserved
 Pot 5: Select editable global parameter. all the way to the left is off
 Pot 6: possibly edit that parameter  
 
Note that if pot 1 and pot 5 are at non-zero, pot 1 overrides pot 5

 -buttons turn on and off notes
 -F-buttons switch between the 6 tracks
 
 L-shift plus button sets you in edit mode for that step (STEP EDIT MODE). L button stays flashing or lit
   In this mode you can edit velocity and probability
   L shift by itself or selecting a vel/prob by clicking a button takes you out of the mode

 L-shift plus track button mutes/unmutes

 L-shift and pot 3 displays tempo
 
 R-shift plus F button 1..4 selects the pattern.
 R-shift plus F6 toggles pattern hold


 Holding R shift, bottom row of step buttons indicate 4 probability selections and cycle selection
  pushing one of these buttons (R shift still held) selects that setting (prob 1..4, cycles)
  for editing
  Top two rows indicate level for selection, and can be pressed to select
  all of this while R shift is held
  

 Clicking either L or R shift while holding the other toggles playback

Indicators:
NO mode:
- When playing, current step will flash
- F light will indicate current track
- lights for ON steps will be lit

LEFT mode:
- total number of steps in track will light
- unmuted tracks (F lights) will be lit

RIGHT mode:
- F light 1..4 will light with current pattern
- F6 will be lit if pattern hold is in effect
- Bottom row left 5 lights are lit and one is blinking (depending on whether editing pat prob 1..4 or num cycles)
- top two rows indicate as a bar graph the value of current pat prob or num cycles

STEP EDIT mode
- Edited step is flashing
- Top two rows indicate velocity as a bar graph
- Bottom two rows indicate probability as a bar graph
- L shift is lit

POT mode
- depends on what is selected for editing. Each of these has a reserved light which blinks (use labels on the box):
   Top right green light is for indicating yes/no settings with blink=no, solid=yes
