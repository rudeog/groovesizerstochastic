  AS - taking this groovesizer golf as a starting point to make the stochastic sequencer 
  when I started, global vars took up 1559
  1437
  global TODO
  - check for initial assignment in functions of locals, some may not be needed

 We can be playing in any mode
 A pattern will be considered ended when the longest track has run it's course
 
 __Normal mode:
 -Neither L-shift nor R-shift are lit
 -buttons turn on and off notes
 -F-buttons switch between the 6 tracks
 -Pot 1 length in steps of current track
 -Pot 2 midi note for current track
 -Pot 3 clock divider for current track
 
 __Edit mode:
 -R-shift enters cell edit mode (r shift again exits it and returns to normal mode)
 -R-shift is lit
 -hitting a button lets you make that the current step for editing (flashes)
 -Pot 1 adjusts velocity of current step
 -Pot 2 adjusts probability of current step
 -F1-F6 will mute unmute tracks as shown with leds
 
 __Pattern mode:
 Lights F1-F4 show the current pattern
 Light F5 indicates pattern hold (dont switch patterns)
 Light F6 if lit means delay switch till end of pattern
 -L-Shift enters pattern mode (and again exits it)
 -F1-F4 select current pattern which will switch right away or after current pattern is done depending on setting (if playing)
 -Pot 5 sets number of times to play pattern
 -Pot 1-4 set probability of next pattern and is shown as a scale on rows 1-4
 -F6 set whether to switch patterns immediately or after current pattern end (lit means delayed switch)
 -F5 pattern hold - holds the current pattern (toggle) so that it doesn't switch
 
 __Global mode:
 -L-shift and R-shift enter global mode
 -Both L and R shift are lit
 -Pot 1 - midi channel
 -Pot 2 - tempo (0 to set ext clock)
 -Pot 3 - swing
 -Pot 5 - Random regen (how often to regenerate a random number -- every step, every n steps)
 -F1 plus another cell will save to that location
 -F2 plus another cell will load from that location
 -F3 toggle midi thru
 -F4 toggle midi send clock
 
 __All modes:
 pot 6 is play/pause/stop - left is stop, right is play, middle is pause

S T O R A G E
We will have:
1 channel selection
tempo selection 0=slave, 1-255=tempo
swing
 *4 patterns
number of times to play pattern (count) 4bit 1-16
probability of next pattern to play 1-4 (After count above), 3 bits each where 0 is never, 7 highest
6 tracks (each track can play one midi note)
 length selection for track (1-32 notes in track) 5 bits
 clock divider (3 bits) speed 4x 2x 1x 1/2x 1/4x
 midi note selection for track
 32 steps:
  velocity level (0=off, 15=highest) 4bits
  probability (1 to 16) 4bits
